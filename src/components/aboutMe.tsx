          ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Isaac Katongole a passionate and result-driven
          frontend developer with expertise in Reactjs, Nextjs for 4 years and I
          love working on projects from scratch. I love what i do.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far, with 4 years of experience, I have managed to improve on my
          coding skills from the way i structure the projects, using version
          controls like git to manage code branches, integrating third party
          services, deploying on hosting platform, working with databases,
          dockerizing application.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked with a few teams (both local and remote) as frontend
          developer mainly using reactjs for building user interfaces for
          websites and web apps.
        </p>

        <p>
          The side-hustles forced me to work on both frontend and backend to
          survive otherwise I would end up with nothing. For the backend, I use
          Nodejs my favorite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please don't hesitate to reach out, I may be the missing part in your
          software developer team. I'm available to work with any team across
          world.
        </p>
